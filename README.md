# Smart Extension Manager

A VS Code extension that automatically detects file types in your workspace and recommends (or installs) the right extensions for you.  
No more wasting time enabling/disabling extensions manually.

- Detects common file types (`.py`, `.js`, `.cpp`, `.java`, etc.)
- Suggests and updates `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions
- Optionally installs extensions directly from inside VS Code
